# PSU_turboSETI
Working with turboSETI on the PSU cluster

This is my attempt at making a repository for all the files associated with running turboSETI on the cluster.

This includes work by Michael Palumbo on his seti-lens repository for the Fall 2020 Astro 576 class project.
It also includes the files I have been working on to use more generally on filterbank data for SETI research.
